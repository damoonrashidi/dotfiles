Here's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let chars: Vec<char> = ('a'..='h').collect();\n    let usizes: Vec<usize> = chars.iter().map(|&c| c.to_digit(36).unwrap() as usize - 10).collect();\n\n    for (i, c) in chars.iter().enumerate() {\n        println!(\"'{}' -> {}\", c, usizes[i]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code first creates a vector `chars` containing all the characters in the range 'a'..='h' using the `collect` method. Then, a new vector `usizes` is created by mapping each character `c` to its corresponding digit using `to_digit(36).unwrap() as usize - 10`. The '-10' adjustment is required because the ASCII value of 'a' is 97, but you want to map it to 0.\n\nFinally, the code prints each character along with its corresponding usize value.\n\nOutput:\n```\n'a' -> 0\n'b' -> 1\n'c' -> 2\n'd' -> 3\n'e' -> 4\n'f' -> 5\n'g' -> 6\n'h' -> 7\n```\n\nNote that this code assumes you want to interpret 'h' as 7, rather than extending the range to include 'i'. If you want to include 'i' and map it to 8, you can change the range to 'a'..='i' and adjust the subtraction accordingly.\nI also need to parse a char to an i8\nTo parse a char to an i8, you can use the `to_digit` method followed by the `unwrap` and `try_into` functions. Here's an example:\n\n```rust\nuse std::convert::TryInto;\n\nfn main() {\n    let c: char = '5';\n    let i: i8 = match c.to_digit(10) {\n        Some(d) => d.try_into().unwrap_or_else(|_| {\n            panic!(\"Failed to convert {} to i8\", c)\n        }),\n        None => panic!(\"Invalid digit: {}\", c),\n    };\n\n    println!(\"Parsed char '{}' to i8: {}\", c, i);\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the `to_digit` method on the char `c` to attempt converting it to a base-10 digit. This method returns an `Option<u32>`, so we match against it:\n\n- If the conversion succeeds (`Some`), we use the `try_into` function to convert `d` to an `i8`. If the conversion fails, `try_into` returns an `Err` that we handle with `unwrap_or_else`, printing an error message and terminating the program.\n- If the conversion fails (`None`), we also print an error message and terminate.\n\nFinally, we print the parsed char and its corresponding i8 value.\n\nOutput:\n```\nParsed char '5' to i8: 5\n```\n\nNote that this code assumes the input char is a digit. If you plan to handle non-digit chars or a broader range of characters, you may need to adjust the conversion logic or use additional parsing methods.\n","messages":[{"id":0,"start":0},{"id":1,"start":86},{"id":2,"start":1342},{"id":3,"start":1379},{"id":4,"start":2658}],"message_metadata":{"1":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-11-18T11:24:45.655693+01:00","status":"Done"},"4":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-11-18T11:27:29.980880+01:00","status":"Done"},"2":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-11-18T11:24:45.656304+01:00","status":"Done"},"3":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2023-11-18T11:27:29.980777+01:00","status":"Done"},"0":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2023-11-18T11:24:14.611023+01:00","status":"Done"}},"summary":"Converting 'a' to 'h' to 0 to 7","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"}
